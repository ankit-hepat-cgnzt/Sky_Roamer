    <h2>Terms And Condition And Cancellation Policy</h2>
    </div>
    
    <div class="content">
        1. Your contract in respect of your holiday is made with Sky Roamer, registered in India and all bookings are subject to these terms and conditions.
        <br>
        2. All communications by the Company in relation to your holiday will be sent to the address stated on the booking form.
        <br>
        3. The Company is under no obligation to furnish a breakdown of the costs involved in a holiday.
        <br>
        4. The Company reserves the right to notify you of any increase in price before accepting your booking.
        <br>
        5. Occasionally it may be deemed necessary to make changes to your holiday and the Company reserves the right to do so at any time, and you will be notified of any changes at the earliest possible opportunity. If a major change to your tour is necessary, providing it does not arise from circumstances beyond the Companyâ€™s control, you may choose (i) to accept the change of arrangements (ii) to purchase another holiday from us or (iii) to cancel your holiday. Compensation may be payable in cases of major change as detailed below.
        <br>
        6. No compensation will be payable for minor changes. Minor changes include minimal changes to departure and arrival times, changes to the type of aircraft used and restaurant and accommodation changes to a comparable or superior standard.
        <br>
        7. The Company does not own or manage the aircraft, accommodation, restaurants and other facilities used in conjunction with the tours arranged. While the Company has exercised care in selecting providers of travel, accommodation, restaurants and other facilities, the Company have not had the opportunity to inspect and do not represent that such aircraft, accommodation, restaurants, and other facilities and services have been inspected.
        <br>
        8. The Company is not responsible if you or any member of your party suffer death, illness or injury as a result of any failure to perform or improper performance of any part of our contract with you where such failure is attributable to (i) the acts and/or omissions of any member of the party, or (ii) those of a third party not connected with the provision of your holiday, or (iii) an event which neither the Company or the service provider could have foreseen or prevented even with due care.
        <br>
        9. You are responsible for arranging your own travel insurance, though an appropriate policy can be incorporated into your tour package. Details of all insurance policies held by each member of your party must be provided on the booking form. No booking forms can be accepted without sufficient proof that personal policies have been arranged. Please ensure that your insurance cover applies to the specific activities you are booking and which are confirmed on the Confirmation Invoice.
        <br>
        10. Each member of the party must have a valid passport, visas and all necessary documentation for the countries they are touring. The Company accept no responsibility for any delay or expense should your documents not be in order.
